The purpose of this recipe is to provide a relatively easy way for anyone to make pizza in their home kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2]>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (530 ml) warm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar (12g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (9g) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (18 g) kosher salt</li>
        <li>5 cups (600g) bread flour, plus more for working the dough</li>
        <li>Additional oil for greasing the dough</li>
        <li>cornmeal, semolina flour, or coarse-ground whole wheat flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 28 oz (828 ml) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2-4 tbsp (30-60 ml) olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp (4g) sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp (a fraction of a gram) dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheese</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24-32 oz (680-910 g) whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella, freshly grated (6-8 oz / 170-225 g per pizza)</li>
        <li>grated parmesan for dusting (10 g per pizza)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the water, sugar and yeast in a large bowl and let sit for a few minutes. If the yeast goes foamy, it's alive and you're good to proceed (if it doesn't, it's dead and you need new yeast).</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil and salt and 5 cups (600g) of bread flour. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add just enough additional flour to keep the dough workable (i.e. not too sticky) and kneed until you can stretch some of the dough into a thin sheet without it tearing. (NOTE: You will probably need to add a lot more flour. The quantity I give here is just a base line to get your started.)</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into four equal balls and put them in four containers (ideally glass).</li>
        <li>Lightly coat the balls and the interior of their containers with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Cover, and either rise at room temperature for two hours, or put them in the refrigerator and let them rise for 1-7 days. (I prefer the long, cold rise).</li>
        <li>When you want to bake, put a pizza stone or pizza steel into your oven (mine works best on a high rack position but every oven is different).</li>
        <li>Preheat to your highest possible temperature, ideally convection, for a full hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Simply mix together the ingredients for the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Liberally dust a pizza peel with cornmeal (or something similar).</li>
        <li>Take the cold dough out of the fridge and dust it in flour.</li>
        <li>Stretch to the widest size and shape that will fit on your peel and stone/steel.</li>
        <li>Top with just enough sauce to lightly coat the surface.</li>
        <li>Dust the sauce layer with parmesan, then cover with the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the stone/steel and bake until the crust is well-browned and the cheese has browned a bit (but, ideally, has not started oozing out an orange grease layer), 6-7 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
