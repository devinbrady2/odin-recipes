    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled cheese is a classic comfort food favorite on a cold day, and it's incredibly simple to make. Gordon Ramsay, however, doesn't believe this, so we're going to be using his recipe so we can dive in depth to all the things he messed up.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Romano Cheese, Sliced to fit bread (depending on size of bread, around 4 slices)</li>
        <li>Asiago Cheese, Sliced to fit bread (depending on size of bread, around 4 slices)</li>
        <li>"Kimchi. Homemade kimchi."</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>2 slices of country bread</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice cheese into "bricks" then slice down to fit bread.</li>
        <li>Slice bread and make sure it is not sliced too thin.</li>
        <li>Butter the outside parts of your slices and season with salt. Flip over and add cheese to both side of the bread and cut to fit (in the video Gordon uses romano with Pepperberry. Add a hint of pink peppercorn if you want the same effect on the romano). Then add a layer of kimchi to one side then fold over and push down.</li>
        <li>Using a cast iron-pan, add a touch of olive oil and get pan hot over medium-high heat and add sandwich. After about 30-45 second push sandwich so it crisps and cheese melts. Flip after about 2 minutes, once slices are nice and crunchy. Keep flipping and pushing down until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Once cheese appears melted take out of pan and serve! (NOTE: It is here where Gordon burns the bread while simultaneously leaving the cheese un-melted, showing how it all comes down to preference at the end of the day.</li>
    </ol>
